Purpose: Introduce and provide rationale for the 2027 application
recommendations

Last Updated: February 3, 2026

Executive Summary

America’s Healthiest Schools has demonstrated strong momentum and plays
a clear role within Healthier Generation’s Theory of Change as a lever
to encourage adoption and implementation of evidence-based policies and
practices. As recognition has scaled to more than 1,000 schools,
maintaining clarity about what the award represents has become essential
to preserving trust, credibility, and value. Staff feedback has surfaced
a growing concern that the current application design can
unintentionally signal recognition for the existence of a policy or
completion of a checklist, rather than the meaningful changes to school
environments the award is intended to recognize.

In practice, earning recognition has always required real
implementation. This includes how the school day is structured, how
access to services is provided, and how policies and practices reach
students in ways that support health and learning. That work is often
rigorous and transformational, but it has not consistently been visible
through the application. As a result, the depth and value of the award
can be unclear, both to schools earning recognition and to the external
audiences we aim to engage.

The 2027 application rewrite presents an opportunity to strengthen the
integrity of the award by more clearly surfacing implementation,
relevance, and impact, while ensuring the program remains accessible,
motivating, and inspiring for schools to engage in the work.

How we will know the application redesign is successful

- More new schools apply for America’s Healthiest Schools recognition

- More evidence-based policies and practices are verified each award
  year

- Currently recognized schools pursue recognition across more topic
  areas

- Schools engage with Healthier Generation beyond initial recognition

- Partners and funders show increased engagement aligned to the award

This document outlines the rationale for the redesign and proposes the
criteria for the 2027 America’s Healthiest Schools application.

I.  Parameters for the 2027 Award Application: Rigor, Fairness,
    Relevance

Responding directly to staff feedback and programmatic need, the award
model requires a clear set of parameters to ensure rigor, fairness, and
relevance across all topic areas. The following parameters define what
the criteria must accomplish.

1.  Each topic award must clearly represent what it means to be an
    America’s Healthiest School. Regardless of topic, each topic award
    must reflect a shared definition of a healthy school and make that
    meaning clear to schools and partners.

2.  Award criteria must be consistent in difficulty across topic areas.

3.  Award criteria must reflect and surface Healthier Generation’s core
    work. If Healthier Generation is actively supporting schools to
    change practice, that work should be visible within America’s
    Healthiest Schools.

4.  The framework must work for both education and public health
    audiences.
    The award should reflect schools as places that support learning and
    as settings for prevention, early intervention, and student support
    to align with the associated outcomes of the TSIA criteria.

5.  Criteria should reflect the needs and realities facing today’s
    students, staff, and school communities.

6.  Criteria must be selected from the TSIA and retain nine topic areas.

7.  A single topic award must be meaningful on its own. Earning one
    topic award should signal strong, credible implementation, not a
    lesser form of recognition compared to achieving recognition in
    multiple topics.

8.  The award model must remain motivating across different school
    contexts
    Recognition should encourage schools at different starting points
    and capacities to adopt and implement evidence-based policies and
    practices.

II. 2027 Application: Criteria Selection

Each topic award includes 4 to 8 TSIA criteria. The criteria expansion
moves the AHS application from a checkbox approach to one that showcases
the actual changes happening in a school building that improve student
well-being.

Thus, AHS criteria were selected based on

1) their likelihood of contributing to the outcomes identified by topic
area and

2) how well they cover the key mechanisms by which schools influence
health: real-time healthy habits development; supportive
conditions/environments, and identification and connection to preventive
services.

Anchoring to National Population Indicators

For the three AHS topic areas where Healthier Generation has explicitly
defined Impact Goals (Nutrition and Food Access, Physical Activity,
Staff Well-Being), our goal in criteria selection was to choose school
practices that, collectively, create conditions for progress toward
those student/staff outcomes.

- Nutrition and Food Access: Increase the proportion of students
  participating in the School Breakfast Program (Healthy People 2030),
  decrease household food insecurity and hunger (Healthy People 2030)

- Physical Activity: Increase the proportion of youth meeting physical
  activity guidelines (Healthy People 2030)

- Staff Well-Being: Decrease the level of burnout experienced by
  teachers (RAND)

For the other six AHS topic areas, we identified relevant student health
or wellness outcomes that research shows are linked to Healthier
Generation’s priorities, including Healthy People 2030 objectives,
tagged to children to improve the health and well-being of children,
adolescents to improve the health and well-being of adolescents, and
schools to promote health, safety, and learning in school settings.

We recognize that implementing these criteria does not guarantee
improvements in a given metric; however, these practices are
evidence-informed and set the stage for positive trends in those
outcomes. In this way, the Impact Goals and outcomes serve as an anchor
— ensuring the AHS criteria maintain a clear line of sight to what
ultimately matters—while we remain careful not to overstate direct
causality.

Grouping TSIA Criteria: What it Means to be one of America’s Healthiest
Schools

The updated criteria emphasize policies and practices that are most
closely tied to the day-to-day experiences of students and staff.
Criteria were prioritized if they contribute to one or more of three
core elements: daily experiences, supportive conditions, and clear
pathways to support when needs arise. Together, these elements define
what it means to be a healthy school.

- Daily Practice (Lived Experiences): What students (or staff) regularly
  do or experience as part of the school day.

- Supportive Conditions: Policies, norms, structures that make health
  and healthy choices easier and consistent.

- Early Identification and Connection to Support: Identify needs and
  trigger action or connection to care.

Together, the grouped criteria describes what it means to be a healthy
school by combining daily experiences, supportive conditions, and clear
pathways to support when needs arise.
